# DistilBERT-Based Real-Time Disaster Detection from Social Media

This project fine-tunes **DistilBERT** on Kaggle’s disaster tweets dataset (10K labeled tweets) to classify whether a tweet indicates a real disaster.  
The model is designed to handle **figurative language, slang, and emojis**, making it more effective for real-world monitoring.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Model**: Fine-tuned DistilBERT with preprocessing + tokenization pipeline.  
- **Performance**:  
  - Accuracy: 82%  
  - Precision: 78%  
  - Recall: 79%  
  - F1 Score: 0.79  
- **Validation**: Tested on confusion matrices and real-world tweets for practical monitoring.
